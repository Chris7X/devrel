# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

1.  Sign a Contributor License Agreement (see below).
1.  Fork the repo, develop and test your changes
1.  Develop using the following guidelines to help expedite your review:
    1.  Ensure that your code adheres to the existing
        [style](https://google.github.io/styleguide).
    1.  Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of tests which all pass.
    1.  Ensure that your code has an accompanying README.md file. See
        [awesome-readme](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) for
        good examples of high-quality READMEs. Please include the following
        information in your README:
        1.  What problem(s) does the solution solve.
        1.  Functionalities offered and instructions on how to use them.
    1.  Add a link to your contribution in the top-level
        [README](https://github.com/Apigee/DevRel/blob/master/README.md)
        (alpha-order).
    1.  Ensure that your submission does not include a LICENSE file. There's no
        need to include an additional license since all repository submissions
        are covered by the top-level Apache 2.0
        [license](https://github.com/Apigee/DevRel/blob/master/LICENSE).
    1.  Ensure all files copied or derived from a third party library is housed
        in the `/third_party` directory. Also ensure that every directory
        inside the third_party directory has a LICENSE file that includes the
        full license text and copyright notice for the library.
    1.  Ensure each file (that take the format of a source file and supports
        file comments) has license headers with an up-to-date copyright date
        attributed to `Google LLC`
        1.  For files in the third_party dir, leave the existing headers in
            place. If you've modified a file, append "Google LLC" to the
            copyright line.
        1.  For Google-authored source files, paste the Apache header text in
            the comments at the top. (If you're using different license,
            include the full text of that license.)
